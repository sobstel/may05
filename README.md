## Built with

Expo, React Native, Redux, Immer, Remeda, TypeScript

## How to run (locally)

- `expo start`
- Expo Dev Tools will open and you'll be able to run the app using iOS simulator,
  Android/device emulator or your physical device.

## Preview

- iOS: [https://testflight.apple.com/join/n5DpL3vA]
- Android: [https://expo.io/@sobstel/may05]

_If you want to play and solve the puzzles, some knowledge about yoga, chakras,
magic squares and memory games may be needed._

## Experiments

- [Expo](https://expo.io/) publishing and distribution (to the App Store)
- Custom pan responder handlers triggering animations
- Using `Animated` directly (instead of `react-native-animatable` or similar)
- Custom momentum scrolling
- Functional components only (react)
- Redux state management using hooks only
- Using `useRef` to store mutable value for the lifetime of the component
