# May05

## Disclaimer

This is NOT a real published app. This is just a sort of playgroud to try various concepts.

## Built with

Expo, React Native, Redux, Immer, Remeda, TypeScript

## How to run

_TODO_

https://expo.io/@sobstel/may05

_If you want to play it and solve the puzzles, some knowledge about yoga, chakras,
magic squares and memory games may be needed._

## Experiments

- [Expo](https://expo.io/) publishing and distribution (to the App Store)
- Custom pan responder handlers triggering animations
- Using `Animated` directly (instead of `react-native-animatable` or similar)
- Custom momentum scrolling
- Functional components only (react)
- Redux state management using hooks only
- Using `useRef` to store mutable value for the lifetime of the component
